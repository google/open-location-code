# Using Plus Codes in Spreadsheets

Being able to work with plus codes in spreadsheets is, for most people, probably the easiest method to work with them in bulk.

This page explains how you can access the Open Location Code functions from Excel, LibreOffice or Google Spreadsheets.

## Google Sheets

There is an [add-on for Google Sheets](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/plus_codes/604254879289) that allows you to create plus codes from latitude and longitude coordinates, and to decode them as well.

The [Google Maps YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@googlemaps) has some [videos showing how to install and use the add-on](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcRbp4LqBpwE5ofG2MN08D_4DJAk9gZBI).

## Excel/LibreOffice

VBA script and instructions are checked into github [here](https://github.com/google/open-location-code/blob/main/visualbasic).

LibreOffice does sometimes have problems.
This may be due to slightly unreliable VBA support in some versions.
