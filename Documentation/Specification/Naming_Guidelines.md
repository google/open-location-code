# Plus Codes and Open Location Code Naming Guidelines

## Why have guidelines?

These guidelines are offered so that people see a consistent reference to the codes and technology.
This will make it easier for them to understand what they are being shown or asked for.

We have chosen two names - one for the technology and one for the actual codes.
The name for the codes reflects and reinforces the importance of the plus symbol, which is how the codes can be recognised.

## Plus Codes

When referring to Plus Codes in English, the **only** term that should be used is "Plus Code", in Title Case.

Some examples of usage are:
* "My Plus Code is CX37+M9."
* "I gave your Plus Code to the cab driver and he found the way without any problems."
* "Will the postcard arrive if I put your Plus Code as the address?"
* "Enter your Plus Code or street address here."

### Global and local codes

Codes that can be decoded to a lat/lng on their own, e.g. 796RWF8Q+WF are referred to as global codes.

The shortened codes, e.g., WF8Q+WF are referred to as local codes, because they work within a local area.

## Open Location Code

When discussing with organisations or developers, refer to the library, algorithm and technology as "Open Location Code".
This can be abbreviated to OLC, is capitalised, and shouldn't be translated.

It shouldn't be used to refer to the actual codes - don't say "Open Location Codes" for example.

## Summary

Having consistent names and presentation will make it easier for people to recognise what is meant, and make it easier for them to use and benefit from the project.
